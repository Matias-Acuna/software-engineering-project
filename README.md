# Software Engineering Project – Analysis, Modeling & Testing

This repository contains a comprehensive **Software Engineering project** developed as part of a university course.  
The project focuses on **requirements analysis, system modeling, business process design, and software testing**, following structured software engineering methodologies.

The objective of this project was not to implement a software product, but to **analyze, design, and document a complete software system** using industry-standard engineering practices.

---

## Project Overview

The project covers multiple phases of the software engineering lifecycle, including:

- Requirements analysis and documentation
- Business process modeling
- System design using UML
- Test planning and validation concepts
- Structured documentation of all project phases

Each phase is documented and organized as part of a complete engineering workflow.

## Modeling and Design

### Business Process Modeling (BPMN)
- Modeling of business processes using BPMN notation
- Identification of actors, workflows, and system interactions
- Clear representation of process logic and responsibilities

### System Modeling (UML)
- UML class diagrams created using professional modeling tools
- Representation of system structure, entities, and relationships
- Emphasis on maintainability and clarity of design

---

## Software Architecture Concepts

- Separation of concerns between system components
- Modular and maintainable system design
- Application of fundamental software engineering principles
- Documentation-driven development approach

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Test Concept
- Definition of testing objectives and strategies
- Identification of test cases and test scenarios
- Consideration of functional and non-functional requirements
- Documentation of expected system behavior and validation criteria

Testing is treated as an integral part of the software engineering process.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- UML modeling tools (e.g. MagicDraw)
- BPMN modeling tools
- Markdown and Microsoft Word for documentation
- GitHub for version control and project organization

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Structured software engineering thinking
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- Business process and system modeling
- Application of UML and BPMN standards
- Test planning and quality assurance concepts
- Professional documentation of complex systems
- Project organization and version control with Git
