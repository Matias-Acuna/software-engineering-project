# Software Engineering Project – Energy Management Dashboard

This repository contains a comprehensive **Software Engineering project** developed as part of a university course.  
The project focuses on the **analysis, architectural design, modeling, and implementation** of an **energy management dashboard**, following structured software engineering methodologies.

The objective of this project was to design and implement a **modular, extensible, and well-architected software system**, with a strong emphasis on **software architecture principles and design patterns**, rather than on user management or deployment aspects.

---

## System Description

The project is centered around the development of an **Energy Management Dashboard** for households or small businesses.  
The purpose of the system is to **monitor, analyze, and visualize energy consumption data** from multiple devices in real time.

The system processes energy consumption values generated by different device types (e.g. refrigerator, heating system, washing machine) and provides an interactive web-based interface for analysis and visualization.

Key characteristics of the system include:
- Real-time processing of energy consumption data
- Visualization of current values, historical data, and aggregated statistics
- Support for multiple analysis algorithms (e.g. average consumption, peak usage, energy saving potential)
- High modularity and extensibility for future device types, analysis strategies, and visualizations

User authentication and device communication are intentionally **out of scope**.  
Device data is **simulated** using timer-based or randomly generated values to focus on architecture and system behavior.

## Project Overview

The project covers multiple phases of the software engineering lifecycle, including:

- Architectural planning and system decomposition
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- Business process and data flow modeling
- System design using UML
- Implementation using TypeScript
- Test planning and validation concepts
- Structured documentation of all project phases

Each phase is documented and organized as part of a complete engineering workflow.

## Modeling and Design

### Business Process Modeling (BPMN)
- Modeling of business processes using BPMN notation
- Identification of actors, workflows, and system interactions
- Clear representation of process logic and responsibilities

### System Modeling (UML)
- UML class diagrams created using professional modeling tools
- Representation of system structure, entities, and relationships
- Emphasis on maintainability and clarity of design

---

## Software Architecture Concepts

- Separation of concerns between system components
- Modular and maintainable system design
- Application of fundamental software engineering principles
- Documentation-driven development approach

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Test Concept
- Definition of testing objectives and strategies
- Identification of test cases and test scenarios
- Consideration of functional and non-functional requirements
- Documentation of expected system behavior and validation criteria

Testing is treated as an integral part of the software engineering process.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- UML modeling tools (e.g. MagicDraw)
- BPMN modeling tools
- Markdown and Microsoft Word for documentation
- GitHub for version control and project organization

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Structured software engineering thinking
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- Business process and system modeling
